### Countries JSON Lists
-------------

**Why did I do another Countries JSON List?**
Well, because the needs of every programmer are different, and I got tired of searching the format I wanted so I decided to format mine the way I wanted.

Currently there are two formats, one is an iteratable array while the other is accessible using an Object key.

> **Note:**
>  * This lists currently do not have the official country names e.g `Republic of Korea` but I plan to add that in the future if I need it.
>  * If you notice any missing countries, misspellings or wrong data please suggest an edit or do a pull request to fix it.
>  * I am also planning on adding more lists in this repo in the future if I need them.
